  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Linking America - The Game of the Future! </h1>
<p> In the not too distant future, due to increasing negative sentiment about the current unsightly squiggly borders on some sides of the United States, a series of land swaps with Canada and Mexico will be enacted.  The result will be a purely rectangular-shaped new country called “America”.  </p>
<p> Jealousy from less geometrically attractive nations will lead to a series of escalating retaliatory tariffs, reducing international trade to a negligible level.  As America’s economy becomes more inwardly focused, a series of government initiatives will encourage the broad dispersal of newly on-shored production facilities across the country.  As workers relocate to these new employment centers, the result will be that the each location (or “pixel”) within America will have highly specialized production of goods needed by all other locations, and general consumption needs for an equal amount of goods produced by each other location. </p>
<p> Due to a shortsighted failure to read and absorb the critical information conveyed by the biennial Conditions and Performance report, the Federal and State governments had not reinvested in the Nation’s critical transportation infrastructure, leaving America as a relatively blank slate from an interstate transportation perspective.  Local governments had invested in keeping their surface connections to immediately adjacent pixels, but moving goods across multiple pixels has become a slow laborious process.     </p>
<p> As a candidate for the exalted position of Director of Transportation Policy Studies, you have been asked to design a new national road network that would efficiently link pixels within America.  Your design will be compared with those of other candidates, and the individual with the best design will be selected to lead the talented staff of the Office in guiding the Nation through a new golden age of evidence-based decision making.  </p>
<p> In designing your network, you should note that roads will allow for much faster long distance movement of goods.  However, every pixel you devote to roads consumes resources that could otherwise be used to produce goods.  Your network design will be awarded points based on its cumulative improvements in travel time between each pixel and each other pixel, relative to a no-build case.  However, points will be deducted for each pixel occupied by a road.  You will be given access to a series of drawing tools allowing you to draw lines and/or add shapes to assist you in designing your network concept.  </p>
<p> If the selecting official judges none of the networks proposed by candidates to be sufficiently efficient, you may be asked to develop a revised design(s) building on what you have learned through your initial (and other candidates’ initial) attempts.  </p>
