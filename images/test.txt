issue:

recently it take a long time to run
posts with many comments slow, ~10 hrs sometimes

check garbage collector

sometimes it fails

awards -- takes a lot of text
	-collects all from posts
	-dont collect all awards for comments

Hong Kong, novels about martial arts
kung fu masters disappear, show up when needed
author (Jin Yong) from the 80s-90s, commonly known all 14 books
whole Hong Kong knew about it, whole China knew about it

Tao Bao (similar to amazon)
even call president of company the leader of the gang from
7th grader

objective, observe before parent
world more mysterious than thought, dont jump to answer question set out
similar dynamic in the political left and the right

next step:
-script that runs regularly (hourly)

-(secondary) encode awards to less text
