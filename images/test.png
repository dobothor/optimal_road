-find out format of image...convert to pixel array
-incorporate analyze image on website [when 'save' button is clicked...shrink image before]

-show images saved in github(?) in gallery tab [sorted by high score]
-simplify paint interface [remove colors, line width, fill]
-develop homepage

[Ross]-write description/intro for game [something like hauling carts, plains vs road, no congestion, all point-point connections counted, minimize the travel time throughout the network but building roads is costly]
[Chuck]-design homepage background--with buttons! ['Play', 'Gallery', 'Credits']
-modify score [should go up and eventually down with road saturation]
-brainstorm additional game elements [ie connect neighborhoods, jobs, food, congestion...]

-'inspect' web page to identify sections of code for simplification
x-find size of canvas

-find where gallery is linked to

-find where size of line is established [just 1 size, smallest]
